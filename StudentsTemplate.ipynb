    "\n",
    "1.  **Splitting the Image**: It takes the source image and splits it into a grid of smaller puzzle pieces.\n",
    "2.  **Calculating Dissimilarity**: It computes a \"dissimilarity matrix,\" which stores a score of how well any two pieces fit together. This is crucial for the genetic algorithm's fitness function.\n",

    "### Task: Implement the `dissimilarity_measure` Method\n",
    "\n",
    "The `dissimilarity_measure` method calculates how different two puzzle pieces are when placed next to each other. This is a key part of the fitness function, as it determines how well pieces fit together.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What You Need to Do:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Implement the `_dissimilarity_measure` method** in the `ImageAnalysis` class.\n",
    "-   The method should take two `PIL.Image` objects (`piece1`, `piece2`) and an `orientation` string (`\"L-R\"` for left-right or `\"T-D\"` for top-down).\n",
    "-   It should return a single `float` value representing the dissimilarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hints:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Convert Images to NumPy Arrays**: Use `np.asarray(piece)` to convert the `PIL.Image` objects into NumPy arrays. This makes it easier to perform mathematical operations on the pixel data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Extract Edges**: Depending on the `orientation`, you need to extract the pixels from the touching edges of the two pieces.\n",
    "    -   For `\"L-R\"` (Left-Right), you need the **right edge of `piece1`** and the **left edge of `piece2`**.\n",
    "    -   For `\"T-D\"` (Top-Down), you need the **bottom edge of `piece1`** and the **top edge of `piece2`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Calculate Dissimilarity**: The dissimilarity can be calculated as the **sum of squared differences** between the pixel values of the two edges. The formula is:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    dissimilarity = sum((edge1 - edge2)^2)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    You can use `np.sum()` and basic arithmetic operations on the NumPy arrays to compute this value."

Data self._chromosome is a 2D array (with the row and column shape like the original image does) of pieces' ids. If the input initial_state (which is a list of pieces' ids) equals NONE then we put a random sequence of ids with the chromosome shape for self._chromosome, otherwise self._chromosome gets the initial_state. So basically this class holds the pieces of the image as the objects of image, one chromosome, which is a layout (permutation), is equal to input state (initial_state) or a local random generated sequence.\n",

In the ImageAnalysis class, we already computed all dissimilarities of any two pieces together and stored them in _dissimilarity_matrix and have access to any of them with get_dissimilarity function. We sum all of these values to show the total dissimilarity of this chromosome. Since the fitness has an inverse connection with dissimilarity we should return 1/total_dessimilarity. Because of the case total_dissimilarity=0 (happens when all the pieces are in their right place), I added 1 to total_dissimilarity to avoid division by 0.\n",

    "First, we exclude elite individuals (like the project said to) cause they go to the next generation without crossover. This gives us non_elites list of individuals. Instead of using random.uniform, I normalized the distribution by dividing each non_elite individual by its fitness to relate a probability to each of them. In a loop over non_elites, I added each individual's fitness to get cumulative_sum and add it to cumulative_probs list. By doing this, an individual with a higher fitness (bigger probability) gets a wider area (range) between 0 to 1, so this individual has more chance that the random number (between 0 to 1) falls in its range.

    "First we need to pick a random piece and put it in (0,0) position. We do this by calling self._initialize_kernel() which is already given to us. After that, functions call each other iteratively and procces the evolution to find candidate_pieces (using different methods with different priorities) and push them in self._candidate_pieces, which is a min heap. Next, we pop from self._candidate_pieces and put the poped piece to kernel with two conditions that it is a valid piece ( self._is_valid_piece(piece_id) ) and its position is not already taken in the kernel. We will do this proccess until the kernel is not full and there is still piece candidate in self._candidate_pieces. For next step, we call self.child() to assemble the new child (a chromosome) as a next gen individual and complete a crossover operation.\n",

If the conditions are not satisfied, then we check _get_buddy_piece result and add it with the same conditions and return.

We do this for both parents and check if they are equal which means both parents share a neighbor for piece_id and so they both agree on the same piece to be in piece_candidate which is a strong indicator of a correct chromosome.

For finding this minimum using numpy array operations (to be more efficient like the discription asks to), I defined a boolean array named \"mask\" to apply the two mentioned conditions. I used mask to excule the pices we do not want to check. Eliminating those pieces, we get two lists (valid_dissimilarities and valid_piece_ids) that we can simply find the minimum dissimilarity among them and return the min dissimilarity value and its coresponding piece as the best match piece.\n",

    "The second BIG problem was that after filling the empty pieces, when we should return the new individual as the child, we should  give Individual class's constructor the pieces' ids that we made (the new chromosome as the new child) by passing it as its initial_state. But what the provided was doing, was not giving what we made to Individual's contructor and so, the constructor would put its defualt value which is None. That will make a whole new randomly generated chromosome and ignoring the crossover result each time! Therefor I changed this function to fix these problems.\n"

    "### Answer to the questions of part 1 :\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### *question 1*\n",
    "Having 48 pieces would give 48! uniqe chromosomes (since there is 48 ids and 48 places to fill) which can be rounded to 10 to the power of 61 !\n",
    "\n",
    "##### *question 2*\n",
    "This algorithm did not work correctly on the chessboard image. The main reason is that the usual fitness function that we used for other images will not work on chessboard, becuase chessboard is made of white and black squers and each squer has a high dissimilarity on its edges with a neighbor squer and our fitness functions interpret that do a low fitness value! While that is how a chessboard is, each squer is srounded by its oposite color (high dissimilarity on the edges).Using our usual fitness function, this algorithm tries to put pieces with the same color beside each other since that is how it will get a higher fitness value (which is wrong!). by passing a different fitness function to our algorithem we can fix this problem with chessboard image.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### *question 3*\n",
    "Simple crossover methods like one-point or two-point are generally ill-suited for the jigsaw puzzle problem because they destroy crucial local information and frequently produce invalid chromosomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fitness of a puzzle solution depends entirely on the connections between adjacent pieces. Simple crossovers randomly select a segment of pieces from one parent and combine it with a segment from the other. This process is highly likely to break many correct boundary connections built up in the parents, resulting in a child that is much worse than both parents.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a permutation problem, every piece id must appear exactly once. If you use standard one-point crossover on two parents, cutting and splicing results in children that contain duplicates and miss pieces. Therefore, simple operators cannot be used directly and require complex repair mechanisms (which are often slow and ineffective).\n",
    "\n",
    "The heuristic, neighborhood-based crossover we implemented is necessary because it prioritizes preserving and inheriting high-quality local adjacencies, which is the sole factor determining a good puzzle solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### *question 4*\n",
    "High selection pressure, often achieved by heavily favoring the absolute best individuals, can lead to premature convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Premature Convergence: This occurs when the population quickly becomes dominated by individuals that share the same suboptimal genetic material. Because the best individuals are chosen exclusively, the algorithm rapidly loses the diversity needed to explore the entire solution space. For a jigsaw puzzle, this means the algorithm might find a good local arrangement of, say, the top-left corner, and then fail to discover better connectivity solutions for the rest of the puzzle because all subsequent generations are variations of that single, flawed local optimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods like Tournament Selection help maintain diversity by mitigating this intense pressure. In Tournament Selection, a small subset ($k$) of individuals is randomly sampled from the population, and only the best among that subset is chosen as a parent.This process gives weaker individuals a chance to compete and occasionally win a tournament if their random competitors are even weaker. By allowing individuals with potentially beneficial but currently hidden genes to survive and breed, Tournament Selection slows down the rate at which the population loses genetic material.This preserved diversity prevents the population from settling too quickly on the first good solution it finds, allowing the search process to continue exploring more varied configurations and eventually discover the fully solved puzzle.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### *question 5*\n",
    "The primary role of mutation is to restore and maintain genetic diversity by introducing entirely new genetic information that may have been lost during selection and crossover, preventing the GA from getting stuck in a local optimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "It ensures that every possible piece placement can eventually be reached, helping the algorithm jump out of fitness valleys.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Risk of too low mutation rate (e.g.,0.001) (Under-exploration):\n",
    "\n",
    "The risk is stagnation and premature convergence (similar to high selection pressure).The crossover and selection process will quickly remove genetic material that appears suboptimal, and the mutation operator won't introduce new material fast enough to replenish the lost diversity. The algorithm will get stuck in the nearest local optimum and stop improving.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Risk of too high mutation rate (e.g., $0.5$ or more) (Random Search):\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm essentially converts into an inefficient random search.Every time a highly fit child is created through crossover, the high mutation rate immediately scrambles its hard-won, correct adjacencies. The genetic information passed down from parents is destroyed almost instantly. The algorithm spends most of its time evaluating near-random individuals, losing the power of evolutionary search and requiring excessive generations to find the solution."

    "You are required to implement the core Minimax algorithm with **Alpha-Beta pruning**.\n",

    "## Task 1: Implement the Evaluation Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation function estimates how good a game state is for the AI agent. A good evaluation function considers:\n",
    "- **Score Difference**: The primary factor (your score vs opponent's score)\n",
    "- **Strategic Position**: Boxes that are almost complete, control of the board, etc.\n",

    "1. **Minimax**: \n",
    "   - Maximizing player tries to maximize the score\n",
    "   - Minimizing player tries to minimize the score\n",
    "   - Recursively evaluate game states to find the best move\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Alpha-Beta Pruning** (REQUIRED):\n",
    "   - Alpha (α): The best value the maximizer can guarantee\n",
    "   - Beta (β): The best value the minimizer can guarantee\n",
    "   - If β ≤ α at any point, prune (skip) the remaining branches\n",
    "   - This dramatically reduces the number of nodes evaluated\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Depth Limiting**:\n",
    "   - Use `max_depth` to limit how far ahead the algorithm looks\n",
    "   - When depth limit is reached, use the evaluation function"

    "##### *question 1*\n",
    "```\n",
    "Search Depth (d)    Execution Time      Nodes Evaluated     Decision Accuracy (Win Rate)\n",
    "Low (e.g., d=2)     Low (≈O(b2))        Low                 Poor/Moderate. The AI only sees immediate gains/losses. Prone to blunders that lose the game in the long run.\n",
    "Medium (e.g., d=4)  Moderate (≈O(b4))   Moderate            Good. Balances foresight with speed. Can usually avoid traps and set up multi-move sequences.\n",
    "High (e.g., d=6)    High/Very High  (≈O(b6)) High/Very High  Excellent. Sees deep into complex scenarios (especially mid-game). Computationally expensive and slow.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Trade-off Between Accuracy and EfficiencyIncreasing the search depth creates a direct trade-off:Decision Accuracy (Foresight): Higher depth increases the ability to see further ahead, which is critical in a game like Dots and Boxes where a single move can lead to a long chain of points (a \"chain play\"). Deeper search leads to higher accuracy and a better win rate. * Computational Efficiency (Speed): The required time and number of nodes evaluated grow exponentially with depth, O(b^d).\n",
    "This exponential growth severely limits how deep the search can go before moves take too long, making the agent impractical or unusable.Suggesting an Optimal DepthThe optimal depth balances the desire for strong play with the need for timely moves. \n",
    "Initial/Endgame: A lower depth (d=2 or d=4) might be sufficient at the start when the board is open.\n",
    "Mid-Game/Complexity: For a small board, d=6 might be feasible. For a standard 5 \\times 5 board, d=4 is often the maximum practical depth.A good optimized depth for a competitive game is often found empirically: Find the maximum depth d where the average move time is acceptable. Based on typical Dots and Boxes complexity, this is often d=4 or d=5 when Alpha-Beta pruning is fully functional.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### *question 2*\n",
    "The order of moves is highly critical to the performance of Alpha-Beta pruning:Efficiency: Alpha-Beta Pruning works by checking if the current branch's guaranteed value ($\\alpha$ for the maximizer, $\\beta$ for the minimizer) makes exploring the rest of the branch redundant. To maximize pruning, the algorithm must evaluate the best moves first.Optimal Ordering: If the best move is checked early, the $\\alpha$ value rises rapidly and the $\\beta$ value drops rapidly, quickly closing the $[\\alpha, \\beta]$ window and allowing early pruning of suboptimal branches.Worst-Case Scenario: If moves are ordered poorly (e.g., randomly), the algorithm might evaluate a much larger portion of the tree, approaching the time complexity of the unpruned Minimax search (O(b^d)).Analysis of the Provided _order_moves StrategyThe provided _order_moves strategy is a strong heuristic for Dots and Boxes:Prioritize Completing Moves: Moves that scored=True are placed first. These are the most critical moves as they give the current player an extra turn, which is hugely beneficial and must be explored early.Prioritize Safe Moves: Moves that don't increase the count of 3-edge boxes are considered \"safe.\" These are placed second. This avoids immediately setting up the opponent for a score.Prioritize Risky Moves: Moves that create a new 3-edge box (boxes_at_3 count increases) are deemed \"risky\" and placed last. These moves are least likely to be the best, making them ideal candidates for pruning.Conclusion: This ordering is specifically tailored to the game mechanics and is effective for maximizing the efficiency of Alpha-Beta pruning by prioritizing high-value (scoring) and low-risk (safe) moves.Suggested Strategic EnhancementA strategic enhancement to the evaluation function or move ordering would involve recognizing and prioritizing Double-Cross threats or Chain-Play potential.Suggested Enhancement: Analyze Chain-Play PotentialThe current heuristic only penalizes the state where a box is at 3 edges. A better strategy is to detect moves that start a guaranteed sequence of scores (a chain play).Implement a Lookahead Check in _order_moves: For all moves that result in a score (completing_moves), perform a very shallow (depth 1 or 2) search to see how many additional consecutive scoring moves follow.Refined Ordering: Rank the completing_moves list by the length of the scoring chain they initiate. A move that scores 3 boxes consecutively is vastly better than a move that scores 1 box and then forces a handover."
